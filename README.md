# Facial-Expression-Analysis-using-CNN



The following project uses state-of-art Convolution Neural Network(CNN) to recognise seven emotions from a captured human face.

Libraries Used:
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCv
QT designer

An UI is developed using qt designer tool and the backend is programmed using QT-tools in python.

The UI has continuous stream from the USB camera.
Once the emotion is predicted by the system a plot of all emotions with relevent statastics can be found.

The application of this project could be in medical field,IT sector, E-Commerce etc
